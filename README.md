# enno_train_delay
This little project parses the train delay table from the German railway company Enno. They are publishing their train delay information primarily on their website and any other information is not available (until you're already wondering where your train is).
- Written in Python 3
- requires the Gecko driver because the information is published with Javascript
- Covered by some tests
